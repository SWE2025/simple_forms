      <!-- 4. We access these data in backend by using the attribute 'name' value (in our case 'usernamePHP' and
       'passwordPHP') as the key to identify received data in back end.
       PHP example:
            $username = $_POST["usernamePHP"];
       View "check.php" file. -->
      <input type="submit" value="Login" />
      <!-- 5. It is mportant to remember that the type of login button
      input must be "submit" in order to submit the form where it belongs to.
      If the type is "button", the form will not be submitted. -->

<!-- 6. Final Note: every time you have to send / receive data, use network tab in your browser.
 For each request, you may check sub-tabs "request" and "response" to read data you send and response you receive.
